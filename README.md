# oldSchoolChef
A Google Chrome extension to view codechef problems with the old UI

I felt that the old codechef UI is a lot more minimalistic and simpler than the current one, so I decided to make this extension that would automatically take you to the old problem statement page (using 'problems-old' in the URL)

Since I haven't deployed this extension, you will only be able to run it locally by following these steps : 
- Clone this repository
- Make sure you have the latest stable version of Chrome, with developer mode enabled. 
- Click the 'Load Unpacked' button in the chrome extension page (chrome://extensions)
- Specify the location of your cloned repository in your device.
- And you're done! 

(Can also be added as a 'temporary add-on' on Firefox)
